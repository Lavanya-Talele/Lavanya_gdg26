L-System Visualizer using Tkinter and Turtle

This is a simple Python project that shows how L-systems work using drawings. An L-system starts with a basic string (called an axiom) and keeps replacing characters using rules to create bigger and more complex recursive patterns. These patterns are then drawn on the screen using turtle graphics.

The program has a small GUI where the user can enter the axiom, rules, angle, and number of iterations. When the Generate button is clicked, the program expands the L-system step by step and draws the result inside the same window.

The turtle understands basic commands like moving forward, turning left or right, and branching using appropriate symbols. Branching allows the program to draw tree-like structures. The drawing is also optimized so it doesn’t lag when the pattern becomes large, and the color changes slightly to make the output look more attractive.
